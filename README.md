This repository hosts the project developed for the Artificial Intelligence class, a third year course.

The project I developed consists of a program that, given an initial distribution of spectators in a cinema, aims to find another distribution that minimizes the number of trades compared to the initial one and that tries to put groups of friends together. A combination of simulated annealing and genetic algorithms was used to find the final distribution.
